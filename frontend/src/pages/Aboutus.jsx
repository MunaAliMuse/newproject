            <p className=" text-1xl font-semibodl px-12 pb-4  py-2 text-center ">When we started xijaabo Online Courses back in 2018, <br /> our goal was to give Somalis from all across <br /> the world the ability to learn the skills they’d <br /> need to succeed in this modern century. We set out to create a new, <br /> interactive way of learning — making it engaging, flexible, <br /> and accessible for as many people as possible. Since then, <br /> we have helped hundreds of Somali people worldwide unlock modern <br /> technical skills and reach their full potential through code. <br /> There are two commitments we've made to the world. <br /> We've been grounded by these since day one: Increase access <br /> to high-quality education for everyone, everywhere; <br /> Enhance teaching and learning online through research.
